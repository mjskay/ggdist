\title{Decorate a model fit or sample with data types recovered from the input data}
\usage{
recover_types(model, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A supported Bayesian model fit. Tidybayes supports a variety of model objects;
for a full list of supported models, see \link{tidybayes-models}.}

\item{...}{Lists (or data frames) providing data prototypes used to convert
columns returned by \code{\link[=spread_draws]{spread_draws()}} and \code{\link[=gather_draws]{gather_draws()}} back into useful data types.
See \emph{Details}.}
}
\value{
A decorated version of \code{model}.
}
\description{
Decorate a Bayesian model fit or a sample from it with types for
variable and dimension data types. Meant to be used before calling
\code{\link[=spread_draws]{spread_draws()}} or \code{\link[=gather_draws]{gather_draws()}} so that the values returned by
those functions are translated back into useful data types.
}
\details{
Each argument in \code{...} specifies a list or data.frame. The \code{model}
is decorated with a list of constructors that can convert a numeric column
into the data types in the lists in \code{...}.

Then, when \code{\link[=spread_draws]{spread_draws()}} or \code{\link[=gather_draws]{gather_draws()}} is called on the decorated
\code{model}, each list entry with the same name as the variable or a dimension
in \code{variable_spec} is a used as a prototype for that variable or dimension ---
i.e., its type is taken to be the expected type of that variable or dimension.
Those types are used to translate numeric values of variables back into
useful values (for example, levels of a factor).

The most common use of \code{recover_types} is to automatically translate
dimensions of a variable that correspond to levels of a factor in the original data back into
levels of that factor. The simplest way to do this is to pass in the data
frame from which the original data came.

Supported types of prototypes are factor, ordered, and logical. For example:

\itemize{ \item if \code{prototypes$v} is a factor, the v column in the
returned draws is translated into a factor using \code{factor(v, labels=levels(prototypes$v), ordered=is.ordered(prototypes$v))}.  \item if
\code{prototypes$v} is a logical, the v column is translated into a logical
using \code{as.logical(v)}. }

Additional data types can be supported by providing a custom implementation
of the generic function \code{as_constructor}.

  # without using recover_types(), the `condition` column returned by spread_draws()
  # will be an integer:

  # automatically back-convert factors so that they are labeled with their original levels
