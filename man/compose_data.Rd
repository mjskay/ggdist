\title{Compose data for input into a Bayesian sampler}
\usage{
compose_data(..., .n_name = n_prefix("n"))
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Data to be composed into a list suitable for being passed into
Stan, JAGS, etc. Named arguments will have their name used as the \code{name}
argument to \code{as.data_list} when translated; unnamed arguments that are
not lists or data frames will have their bare value (passed through
\code{make.names}) used as the \code{name} argument to \code{as.data_list}.}

\item{.n_name}{A function that is used to form index variables (a variable
whose value is number of levels in a factor or the length of a data frame in
\code{...}). For example, if a data frame with 20 rows and a factor \code{"foo"}
(having 3 levels) is passed to \code{compose_data}, the list returned by
\code{compose_data} will include an element named \code{.n_name("foo")}, which
by default would be "n_foo", containing the value 3, and a column named "n"
containing the value 20.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{c("data_list", "list")}, where each element
is a translated variable as described above.
}
\description{
Compose data into a list suitable to be passed into an MCMC sampler (JAGS,
BUGS, etc).
}
\details{
This function recursively translates each argument into list elements using
\code{\link{as.data_list}}, concatenating all resulting lists together. By
default this means that: 
\itemize{
     \item numerics are included as-is.
     \item logicals are translated into numeric using \code{\link{as.numeric}}.
     \item factors are translated into numeric using \code{\link{as.numeric}}, 
         and an additional element named \code{.n_name(argument_name)} is added 
         with the number of levels in the factor. The default \code{.n_name}
         function prefixes \code{"n_"} before the factor name; e.g. a factor
         named \code{foo} will have an element named \code{n_foo} added containing
         the number of levels in \code{foo}.
     \item lists are translated by translating all elements of the list
         (recursively) and adding them to the result.
     \item data.frames are translated by translating every column of the data.frame
         and adding them to the result.  A variable named \code{"n"} (or
         \code{.n_name(argument_name)} if the data.frame is passed as a named
         argument \code{argument_name}) is also added containing the number of rows
         in the data frame.
     \item all other types are dropped (and a warning given)
}

If you wish to add support for additional types not described above,
provide an implementation of \code{\link{as.data_list}} for the type. See
the implementations of \code{as.data_list.numeric},
\code{as.data_list.logical}, etc for examples.
