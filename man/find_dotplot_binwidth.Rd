\title{Dynamically select a good bin width for a dotplot}
\usage{
find_dotplot_binwidth(
  x,
  maxheight,
  heightratio = 1,
  stackratio = 1,
  layout = c("bin", "weave", "hex", "swarm", "bar")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{<\link{numeric}> Data values.}

\item{maxheight}{<scalar \link{numeric}> Maximum height of the dotplot.}

\item{heightratio}{<scalar \link{numeric}> Ratio of bin width to dot height.}

\item{stackratio}{<scalar \link{numeric}> Ratio of dot height to vertical distance
between dot centers}

\item{layout}{<\link[=character]{string}> The layout method used for the dots. One of: \itemize{
\item \code{"bin"} (default): places dots on the off-axis at the midpoint of
their bins as in the classic Wilkinson dotplot. This maintains the
alignment of rows and columns in the dotplot. This layout is slightly
different from the classic Wilkinson algorithm in that: (1) it nudges
bins slightly to avoid overlapping bins and (2) if the input data are
symmetrical it will return a symmetrical layout.
\item \code{"weave"}: uses the same basic binning approach of \code{"bin"}, but
places dots in the off-axis at their actual positions (unless
\code{overlaps = "nudge"}, in which case overlaps may be nudged out of the
way). This maintains the alignment of rows but does not align dots
within columns.
\item \code{"hex"}: uses the same basic binning approach of \code{"bin"}, but
alternates placing dots \code{+ binwidth/4} or \code{- binwidth/4} in the
off-axis from the bin center. This allows hexagonal packing by setting
a \code{stackratio} less than 1 (something like \code{0.9} tends to work).
\item \code{"swarm"}: uses a version of the \code{"compactswarm"} layout from
\code{\link[beeswarm:beeswarm]{beeswarm::beeswarm()}} (with minor modifications to improve visual
symmetry when \code{side = "both"}). Does not maintain alignment of rows or
columns, but can be more compact and neat-looking, especially for
sample data (as opposed to quantile dotplots of theoretical
distributions, which may look better with \code{"bin"}, \code{"weave"}, or
\code{"hex"}).
\item \code{"bar"}: for discrete distributions, lays out duplicate values in
rectangular bars.

}
\value{
A suitable bin width such that a dotplot created with this bin width
and \code{heightratio} should have its tallest bin be less than or equal to \code{maxheight}.
}
\description{
Searches for a nice-looking bin width to use to draw a dotplot such that
the height of the dotplot fits within a given space (\code{maxheight}).
}
\details{
This dynamic bin selection algorithm uses a binary search over the number of
bins to find a bin width such that if the input data (\code{x}) is binned
using a Wilkinson-style dotplot algorithm the height of the tallest bin
will be less than \code{maxheight}.

This algorithm is used by \code{\link[=geom_dotsinterval]{geom_dotsinterval()}} (and its variants) to automatically
select bin widths. Unless you are manually implementing you own dotplot \code{\link{grob}}
or \code{geom}, you probably do not need to use this function directly

\examples{

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

x = qnorm(ppoints(20))
binwidth = find_dotplot_binwidth(x, maxheight = 4, heightratio = 1)
binwidth

bin_df = bin_dots(x = x, y = 0, binwidth = binwidth, heightratio = 1)
bin_df

# we can manually plot the binning above, though this is only recommended
# if you are using find_dotplot_binwidth() and bin_dots() to build your own
# grob. For practical use it is much easier to use geom_dots(), which will
# automatically select good bin widths for you (and which uses
# find_dotplot_binwidth() and bin_dots() internally)
